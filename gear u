What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?

A bottom line, basic connection. Empthanthy is how we connect, and I've tried to do so for friends and family. I am a bit of 
a loner to be honest. However when recognizing good and bad situations of others, empathy helps you join with them for good 
or bad. Live the good times, get through the bad times.

How does empathy help you build better software?

After reolizing how many of those "bad times" can happen (improper syntax, spelling errers tec...) it's good to reach out and 
for a helping hand. I'm sure that if anyone else comes up with an error or a pile of projects, they would like and need help 
with reasurance. We all need that from time to time.

Why is empathy important for working on a team?

Function, flow, friendship and just acting like a decent individual. A team is in it together.

Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.

Being a barista, multi-tasking and milk steaming can be challenging. It sure is stressful for a few old co-workers of mine. 
But reassuring them that even I have made mistakes like they have, or admitting how the grind gets me down as well comforts 
and encoureges them. Let's them know they're not alone.

When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? 
How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios? 

Sometimes i find it difficult depending on a personal situation. If someone is going through trouble outside of work and bring 
that stress with them, of course I would like them to do well and feel relieved. However if this personal situation was caused 
by them "shooting themself in the foot" I tend to be a bit more indifferent.
Perhaps I should just simply be an ear to listen.
