Step 3 Questions

1) What is your greatest streangth and how do you know?
  
  Virsitility has allowed me to grow as both a person and a proffesional. Managing numerous skills in construction has always been a neccecity, however I adapt quickly.I have never worked in an enviorment where transitioning had proven to be difficult whether its getting along with staff or following proceadures and task for the job.
  
2) How do you work best?
  
  Most of my work experience has been in a casual environment. I find strict and framed envoirnments only a bit more organized but far more constricting. I prefer to work independantly, more so for focus, but also to improve via trial and error. I have no problem working with groups as I usually adjust well to different types of crowds. 
  
3) What is your greatest area of improvment?
  
  Organisational skills are definatly an area in need of improvment. I believe that any type of activity (work, school, recreation, leisure) requires momentum and follow through. Sometimes these activities don't have much momentum because of a weak start due to disorginization. Usually with help from a journal I know where to start with a task and understand that the "activity" itself isn't intimidading, but getting myself started can be overwhelming due to poor organizing. Outside of a journal or notebook I really dont have to many organisational skills. It also gets in the way of self expression. 
  
4) How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?
  
  Aside from learning just another new skill, I am hoping to learn more about a new culture. Majority of my experience has been either manual labor or service indusry. Learning multiple skills and working with numerous people among multiple states, that has made me versitile, and with that I have learned to talk and cooperate with an array of characters. I am hoping this will be true for this envirnment as well.
  
5) How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?
  
  To be honest, I am not completely sure aside from deciding a workplace enviornment or a goal I choose to apply my skills towards. Understanding my strengths and prefrences would help me understand my worth and effort going into software develoupment. Hopefully I will learn to better appreciate my streagnths and prefrences going into this cohort.
  
Step 5 Questions
  
1) What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful? What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?

  Whenever I learn somthing new, I imediatly seperate what comes easy to me and what doesn't, and would try to use what I know to find my faults in what I don't understand. If A is somthing I understand, B is difficult to grasp and C is the expected answer, rather than sticking with A+B=C I would rearange this formula as C-A=B and ask how. Two of my biggest challeges tend to be knowing what questions to ask and how to articulate them. With the A+B=C example, changing perspective helps me grasp what questionns need to be asked, and more importantly what questions need to be answered. Though sometimes it is difficult to find the right perspective.
  
2) How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?
  
  Kathy Sierra's presentation came as a relief, especially towards the end and explaining how pattern recongition is more of a develoupment rather than a skill to learn or method to teach. Just sitting and reviewing the same thing over and over again in the exact same manor just seems to teach me that there is only one way to learn a specific solution, rather than actually learning problem solving skills to find a solution. Ta-Nehisi Coate's article about learning french is a fresh reminder how sometimes it's easy to start something new but difficult, at least for me, to get a proper launch into what you're learning. Alot of doubt begins to develop as my largest obstical, but you got to tell yourself this is only now and it's not going to be like this down the road.
  
3) What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?

  Usually outside emotional influences don't get in the way of unrealated topics. M emotions are influenced by one thing I just keep them related to that one thing. If there was a reason I was mad or sad or overwhelmed at a job for example, I know it's only related to that what happened at that job and not another other envirnment such as home or school. Putting in an effort not to have my emotional state influence or distract me. I suppose not alot of effort, but sometimes hearing other's perspective may help focus. If someone were to come up to me and say "You don't seem like yourself" or "You're awefully quite" might help change my perspective.
  
4) How will you prepare yourself to be at your best with your learning process while at Turing?

  Allowing myself time to review and process the course with a fulltime commitment. Getting into a more routine lifestyle than i'm use to. I would like to review more presentations from Kathey Sierra as well as any other sourced material offered.
