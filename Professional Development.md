What is your greatest streangth and how do you know?
  Virsitility has allowed me to grow as both a person and a proffesional. Managing numerous skills in construction has always been a neccecity, however I adapt quickly.I have never worked in an enviorment where transitioning had proven to be difficult whether its getting along with staff or following proceadures and task for the job.
  
How do you work best?
  
  Most of my work experience has been in a casual environment. I find strict and framed envoirnments only a bit more organized but far more constricting. I prefer to work independantly, more so for focus, but also to improve via trial and error. I have no problem working with groups as I usually adjust well to different types of crowds. 
  
What is your greatest area of improvment?
  
  Organisational skills are definatly an area in need of improvment. I believe that any type of activity (work, school, recreation, leisure) requires momentum and follow through. Sometimes these activities don't have much momentum because of a weak start due to disorginization. Usually with help from a journal I know where to start with a task and understand that the "activity" itself isn't intimidading, but getting myself started can be overwhelming due to poor organizing. Outside of a journal or notebook I really dont have to many organisational skills. It also gets in the way of self expression. 
  
How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?
  
  Aside from learning just another new skill, I am hoping to learn more about a new culture. Majority of my experience has been either manual labor or service indusry. Learning multiple skills and working with numerous people among multiple states, that has made me versitile, and with that I have learned to talk and cooperate with an array of characters. I am hoping this will be true for this envirnment as well.
  
How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?
  
  To be honest, I am not completely sure aside from deciding a workplace enviornment or a goal I choose to apply my skills towards. Understanding my strengths and prefrences would help me understand my worth and effort going into software develoupment. Hopefully I will learn to better appreciate my streagnths and prefrences going into this cohort.
